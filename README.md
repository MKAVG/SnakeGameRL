Snake Game !!

Implementation of Snake game with the approach of Reinforcement Learning.

This thesis purposes a Deep Q Learning (DQN) approach for a game of snake.

An reinforcement learning agent has been trained so that it can learn how to play a game of snake.

The performance of the snake game has been compared with the performances of Snake games which used algorithm based snake bots, such as bots following depth-first search and breadth-first search algorithms to play the game.
